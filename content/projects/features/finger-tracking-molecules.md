I brought molecule interaction to VR, allowing remote students to learn chemistry.

Movement interaction was pretty easy to implement via finger pinch values.

<p>
One problem that arose with finger tracking was enabling rotation for the molecules.

<p>
Smooth rotation was accomplished by using the molecule as the epicenter and calculating the difference in angles relative to angle the interaction was initiated at.

<p> 
For budgeting sake it was enough to allow rotation with another hand, where the other can freely move the objects.
